# Thesis-simulations-in-Julia
This repository contains the Julia scripts used to make the plots within my master thesis. In order to create them yourself download all .jl files, put them in the same folder, go with Julia REPL to this folder and run the command: `include("All_observers_simulation.jl")`. After the script finished running can the two plots be accessed using `figs[1]` and `figs[2]` respectively, which can then be saved to an image if desired. It can be noted that this code uses the package LinearAlgebra, DifferentialEquations, Plots and LaTeXStrings, so make sure that these are installed.
